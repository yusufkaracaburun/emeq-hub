# Dev environment

Stack-agnostic — agents detect tooling from this repo and consult **official documentation** for commands.

## Detected in this repo

- Package manager: npm (`npm ci`)
- Frameworks: laravel
- Build script: `vite build`


## How to find commands

1. Check scripts in `package.json`, `composer.json`, Makefile, or project README
2. Respect the lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, `package-lock.json` → npm)
3. If unclear, look up the **official docs** for the detected framework/tooling (links below)
4. Do not assume a stack — use what this repo actually contains

## Docs lookup rule

When install, test, build, or deploy commands are unclear:

1. Read repo scripts and CI config first
2. Fetch or search the **official documentation** linked below (verify URL is current)
3. Note the docs version when relevant (e.g. Laravel 11 vs 12 from `composer.json`)
4. Cite the source in ADRs or comments for non-obvious architectural choices
